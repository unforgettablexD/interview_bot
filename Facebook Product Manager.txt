[Music]
0:06
hey everyone uh we're here today to do
0:09
another
0:10
exponent mock interview we're going to

0:18
hey thank you for having me um so my
0:20
name is albert i'm an incoming product
0:22
manager at facebook

i was actually a client of exponent and
0:26
it was really helpful for me
0:28
before that i was at kareem karim is a
0:32
ride-hailing and the super app of the
0:33
middle east region
0:34
and it was acquired by uber i think last
0:37
year
0:38
and before that i worked on different
0:39
startups in different industries
0:42
in the middle east region awesome well
0:44
we're super excited to have you all bet
0:45
and
0:46
it's so cool to hear that exponent has
0:47
worked well for you for those of you
0:49

0:52
coaching and community you can go to try
0:54
exponent dot com
0:55
um now i want to jump into this facebook
0:58
uh pm
0:59
interview we're going to be doing an
1:00
execution style interview so it's going
1:02
to be focused more on analytical type
1:04
uh things like that and abed should be a
1:06
pro given that he just went through
1:07
the interview process um and so the
Question
1:10
question that i'd like to ask you today
1:12
about is you're the pm for facebook lite
1:14
how would you set goals
1:17
facebook lite great um
1:21
so just a couple of like
1:24
confirmations and questions that i would
Clarifying questions
1:27
like to to kind of like um
1:29
um check with you so facebook lite
1:32
is basically the light version of
1:35
facebook where
1:36
it's catered to like developing
1:39
countries people with
1:41
um less powerful phones and
1:44
like in terms of limited connectivity
1:46
whether on the speed or the download
1:48
code
1:48
is that correct yes that's exactly right
1:51
we use light
1:52
to help people of all bandwidth access
1:55
access facebook
1:56
in the experiences and i think my my
1:59
other question is that
2:00
um i'm going to set the goals for
2:03
today not assuming that i'm going back
2:06
in time with facebook launched like
2:08
is that correct that's right yeah we're
2:10
focusing looking forward for the goals
2:12
um how would we set up the goals but not
2:14
backwards cool cool cool um so just give
2:17
me a second to kind of
2:19
um articulate the mission um if that's
2:21
okay
2:22
that sounds great um and in the meantime

2:41

2:41
and even comments below if you have any
2:44
questions
2:45
we try to answer every single question
2:46
that's asked
2:50
great so the the mission uh for facebook
Mission
2:53
is to
2:54
um give the people to the tools to um to
2:58
connect and kind of like bring the word
3:01
closer together
3:03
and my understanding or the way i see
3:06
facebook live
3:07
is at the code of that mission because
3:10
if you think about it facebook light is
3:12
trying to connect
3:13
the people who are kind of like in
3:16
slightly underprivileged
3:17
circumstances and i think um facebook
3:20
being a champion for
3:22
um inclusivity um and just ensuring that
3:26
everyone is served with
3:27
that service uh is is
3:30
being kind of like the code of the
3:32
mission and facebook being true to this
3:34
to its mission
3:35
i think it's it's a it's uh one of the
3:38
key pillars to kind of like
3:39
bring on board the people who are in
3:42
developed countries with
3:43
uh certain technology limitations
3:46
so that's where i feel light is quite
3:49
important
3:50
and it's it's actually one of the most
3:52
important things
3:54
giving that that
3:57
facebook adoption kind of saturated and
4:00
in the developed world in the developed
4:02
countries and if facebook needs to grow
4:04
then
4:05
kind of needs to to get more users on
4:08
board
4:08
and i think those users are in those um
4:11
developed countries sorry underdeveloped
4:15
countries or developing countries
4:17
so if facebook wants to bring the next
4:20
billion users i think light could be one
4:23
of the strategies
4:24
different strategies could be um the
Strategy
4:28
um the uh the drone that is beaming
4:31
internet or just like allowing more
4:32
access to different
4:34
areas so i think that could be one of
4:36
the strategies to bring
4:37
more users on board got it um now just
4:40
to
4:41
push back a little bit so uh yes we
4:44
could have the
4:45
goals of inclusivity which i love that
4:47
you started there
4:48
um but at what point do we know that
4:51
we're not
4:52
no longer providing the same facebook
4:54
experience so
4:55
i could imagine an argument being made
4:57
like hey maybe facebook should be
4:59
we can print the newsfeed on newspapers
5:01
um and we can put the news feed on
5:02
newspapers we can distribute them to
5:04
like all of people around the world but
5:07
i might be worried about that because
5:09
it's not really providing the same
5:11
experience
5:11
as what facebook is known to provide or
5:14
you know
5:14
it's not the same thing so how would you
5:16
think about whether or not light
5:18
falls into that category of kind of
5:20
being more like a newspaper
5:21
or less like the actual facebook
5:23
experience and trading that off with
5:25
inclusivity
5:26
great i think that's a great question
5:28
and it's a good um
5:30
like exercise to think about it the way
5:32
i think
5:33
about light is is pretty much
5:37
it's it's it's hoping to be
5:40
the cool experience of facebook and
5:44
i think most of us when we're using
5:46
facebook we're using some core
5:47
functionalities
5:49
maybe um looking up at
5:52
certain pictures or messaging people or
5:54
just like updating our status
5:57
so it's still connected to the same
6:00
facebook environment so you're not out
6:01
of the facebook environment
6:03
you're just contributing differently so
6:05
i think that's one way
6:06
the other thing for facebook lite it's
6:10
it's just probably a temporary solution
6:14
if you think about it the word is is
6:16
becoming
6:17
adopting to new technologies faster so
6:20
let's say there is a country that
6:22
doesn't have the support for
6:24
um broadband internet but this country
6:27
will get broadband internet next year
6:29
so you're kind of introducing them to
6:30
the facebook ecosystem and then
6:32
once they sort of like graduate to to
6:36
to become eligible for the full facebook
6:38
experience
6:39
um this is where they can use the uh the
6:41
normal app
6:42
so it's not a completely disconnected
6:44
experience it's just kind of i would say
6:47
more focused on the basic needs that you
6:49
would need
6:50
given the limitation of technology got
6:54
it
6:54
okay um great response and yeah i think
6:56
it sounds like what we want to do is go
6:58
ahead and focus on
6:59
facebook light as an on-ramp into the
7:00
facebook experience then also
7:02
facebook late should really represent
7:04
the core experience of facebook
7:05
and um i like that point as well and a
7:07
facebook newspaper
7:09
does not quite get at the core
7:10
experience of facebook although it could
7:12
be a pretty cool idea
7:13
um so okay so we so we have this mission
7:16
or kind of the high level
7:17
objectives but can we talk a little bit
7:19
more about what specific goals that we
7:21
would set for facebook light and how we
7:22
might go about
7:23
picking those goals um and and even like
7:26
would love a consideration at some point
7:27
in your answer about the tam or the
7:29
total adjustable market
7:30
that we might have here um without this
7:32
product
7:33
got it so i think at this point um
7:36
facebook lite has been there for years
7:38
so as a product it i would say it has
7:42
reached maturity in terms of like
7:44
product itself um but i think
7:47
the core mission of this product is
7:50
to ensure that we're really solving that
7:52
problem that we said we want to solve
7:54
which is connecting
7:55
the people who are um like have those
7:58
certain challenges
7:59
and for that i want to measure
Success metric
8:03
my success as the pm in terms of the
8:06
the adoption rate for this app so
8:09
basically
8:11
looking at the number of people who are
8:13
using the app
8:14
um versus the total addressable market
8:17
that we have
8:19
so almost like everyone who needs the
8:21
app versus how much actually we're
8:23
supporting and how much we're
8:24
we're serving in this new app got it
8:28
so we're going to look at the um
8:30
leftover users or the users that may not
8:32
have access that we
8:33
should be able to access or provide that
8:35
experience
8:36
overall adoption of this facebook like
8:39
that got it
8:42
okay um that makes a lot of sense i
8:45
guess how would we think about
8:47
um why do you think people are not using
8:50
that or
8:51
what is the barriers to facebook like
Barriers
8:53
that we want to address or focus on
8:57
okay so i think um
9:01
i think first of all the what's what's
9:04
unique about facebook and generally all
9:06
the social networks is that
9:08
this network effect where you need your
9:11
friends to be on facebook to kind of
9:13
like be motivated to be on facebook
9:16
so it's it's more or less like a
9:19
snowball effect where
9:20
you want to really advocate certain
9:22
cities
9:23
that who just maybe recently came online
9:26
or recently
9:27
started to get more people connected to
9:29
the internet or
9:30
certain devices so i think
9:34
one of the things we want to look at is
9:37
try to get more users on boarded on this
9:40
app
9:40
um i'm not sure maybe maybe it's it's
9:43
it's a
9:44
it's an education challenge of people
9:46
not knowing about facebook
9:48
but i think most of us back when
9:50
facebook launched we
9:51
knew about it through friends so once
9:53
your friends are there
9:54
you'll be there i mean it's just like
9:56
allowing access for
9:58
people who might not um have this um
10:01
like powerful smartphone etc
10:04
so the way i would i would look at this
10:07
is
10:08
basically trying to onboard these people
10:10
and the way i would look at the total
10:12
addressable market
10:14
is looking at everyone
10:17
with um with let's say a less powerful
10:21
phone
10:22
and this data i might get from the
10:24
manufacturers
10:26
um like number of ship devices etc
10:29
and when it comes to to the network
10:32
um and connectivity challenges
10:36
i'm gonna try to look some data from the
10:38
telcos um
10:39
if if the company can provide us with
10:41
this data
10:42
that would give us the estimated total
10:44
addressable market that we're gonna
10:46
benchmark our um numbers against
10:50
got it so we're gonna look at that to
10:52
kind of get the total adjustable market
10:54
it sounds like you know maybe the telco
10:56
it sounds like what we're gonna look at
10:57
is like the
10:58
bandwidth constraints on phones given
11:01
the different telcos
11:02
and the data that they have or the data
11:03
that we have with telcos
11:05
um so i think that makes a lot of sense
11:08
um and so we can kind of like understand
11:10
or tap into why
11:12
these users or how we can target these
11:13
users um
11:15
but i i do want to kind of come back to
11:16
the bigger question of the goals so like
Goal
11:18
how can we
11:19
um what what exactly is our goal here
11:22
and how are we going to
11:23
achieve that goal or how what are the
11:25
the action steps for that goal
11:27
um with regards to the sector that we're
11:29
talking about great
11:30
great so i would say our goal is
11:33
to ensure that our adoption
11:37
is is is as good as it can be in terms
11:42
of
11:42
number of users who are using this app
11:45
and we're serving
11:46
in the proper way and this goal we can
11:49
define as i mentioned
11:50
basically the number of active users
11:53
monthly active users
11:54
divided by the total address of the
11:56
market so if this number is going up
11:59
then it means that we're actually i'm
12:01
getting closer and closer to our
12:03
um end goal um and
12:06
that's that's when we're talking about
12:08
the goal i think in terms of
12:10
steps talking about the product itself
12:14
um i think the product
12:17
has already proved that it's uh it's a
12:20
good solution
12:21
for many people so it's about growing
12:23
the base
12:25
and in terms of steps
12:28
as i mentioned i believe it's basically
12:31
about
12:33
allowing more people to use it and that
12:35
would give us the
12:36
snowball effect and the network effect
12:38
that more people will
12:39
come on board once their friends are on
12:41
board got it
12:43
um so i love this like now over tan
12:45
metrics the monthly active users over
12:47
the total adjustable market
12:49
um can you tell me like what's the
12:51
downside of that approach or that goal
12:53
basically like if we just focused on
12:55
that goal is there something that you
12:56
might be worried about or a trade-off
Trade-offs
12:58
that we need to consider
13:01
um so i i think
13:04
one thing going back to uh to as you
13:07
mentioned the newspaper and what kind of
13:09
solutions that we want to
13:11
to bring um we shouldn't think about
13:14
the facebook light um in vacuum it's
13:17
it's actually quiet
13:19
connected to the normal app and
13:22
i think it's it's allowed to install
13:24
facebook light and the normal app
13:26
um in different countries so i think
13:30
one downside of just looking at now is
13:33
that basically
13:35
it's um it's it's mixed between the
13:38
people who are
13:39
um actually part of the tam people who
13:42
are
13:43
um on less powerful phones or connection
13:46
um
13:47
limitations with the people who are
13:50
not part of that group so maybe um
13:53
an iphone 11 user would download
13:55
facebook lite
13:57
maybe someone with a powerful android
13:59
phone or with good connection with
14:01
download
14:01
facebook live and that could skew our
14:03
numbers in terms of monthly active users
14:06
so we need to figure out a way um to
14:09
kind of like
14:10
remove that noise and focus on the
14:12
actual
14:14
um the daily monthly active users
14:17
that we care about that kind of like
14:20
they
14:21
they fit with with our um town
14:24
got it yeah that's a great point i i
14:26
think like the
14:27
um the considering
14:30
all the users that might interact with
14:31
the products is really important here
14:33
um so that's great um so it sounds like
14:36
you know just repeat us again so we're
14:38
kind of like ensuring that adoption is
14:39
as good as it can be um
14:41
for facebook and we've considered some
14:43
trade-offs we've considered the metrics
14:45
that we want to look at or evaluate
14:46
um i think one thing one question that i
Follow-up questions
14:49
do have is like
14:50
um you know it sounds like we're gonna
14:52
partner with telcos and kind of
14:53
understand that
14:54
um do you think the main approach here
14:57
it sounds like there's
14:58
maybe two approaches i'd love to hear
14:59
which one you think is better one
15:01
approach is we can really
15:02
improve the product experience for
15:04
facebook light maybe make it more rich
15:06
make it more
15:06
like like uh powerful things like that
15:09
and um we could add more features into
15:11
it that are low bandwidth
15:12
for example let's say that we don't have
15:14
um you know as much as good animations
15:16
maybe we can make the animations better
15:18
for for light users
15:19
the other path we can go down is that we
15:21
can really just try to make
15:23
facebook light itself a lower bandwidth
15:25
product so
15:26
um like we can take let's say it takes
15:28
some number of megabits per second like
15:30
to download or to use we can reduce that
15:32
even further
15:33
um how would you consider these two
15:35
approaches when thinking about facebook
15:37
lite
15:38
because both seem to fit into the idea
15:40
of expanding access and assuring
15:42
adoption is as good as it can be
15:44
one making the product so excellent that
15:46
people are talking about it and sharing
15:47
with their friends
15:48
another making the bandwidth so low or
15:51
the
15:51
constraints um not a problem anymore so
15:53
that users can access it
15:55
uh more readily so how would you think
15:57
about these two paths for the product
15:59
i i think um given the situation that
16:02
we're
16:02
um that we're here now and today
16:05
situation
16:06
the product is mature and i think a lot
16:09
of
16:09
brilliant pms have worked on it and kind
16:11
of like really understood what the users
16:14
cared about
16:15
users who fit in this persona with those
16:17
limitations or and
16:18
those opportunities so what i believe is
16:22
that
16:23
there is a product market effect for
16:25
those people
16:26
it's just about scaling the product into
16:29
people who are
16:31
probably either not aware or people with
16:34
even like um different limitations
16:38
so we might assume that the limitation
16:40
is that you need
16:42
one megabit um connection maybe there
16:45
are people who are left out at
16:47
128 kilobyte like per second
16:51
so maybe on on the product innovation
16:53
side we need to
16:55
to understand first if we really need to
16:57
go and optimize
16:59
more um to capture a bigger market
17:02
my hypothesis for now i think
17:05
that is not the case i think it has been
17:07
optimized and there is a good product
17:09
market fit when it comes to how can we
17:12
make this product a greater success
17:14
um it is about how to scale the product
17:17
in
17:18
the hand of users um basically
17:22
trying to understand what cities have
17:24
not
17:25
yet developed this network effect of
17:28
facebook and how can we
17:30
tap into these communities
17:33
but from a feature perspective i think
17:36
the features
17:37
are quite a good representation of
17:41
what a typical facebook user would use
17:45
it's it's really a great thing to see
17:48
um it's it's not about what you add it's
17:51
not about what you cannot remove
17:52
so i think facebook light has has
17:54
reached that um
17:56
like fine fine line between those things
17:59
awesome um i want to ask one last
18:01
question before we kind of jump to
18:02
feedback and all that kind of stuff
18:03
um what so i want to take us so we're at
18:06
a very high level talking about goals
18:07
i want to take us to zoom in on a
18:09
certain city let's say that we've
18:11
discovered we've partnered with the
18:12
telcos we've discovered that there's a
18:13
city
18:14
that is um does not have facebook light
18:17
and
18:17
majority of usage maybe one percent of
18:19
the users use facebook lite
18:20
um and this city let's just call it um
18:27
you know cityville or something um so
18:29
cityville
18:30
uh has one percent of users that use
18:33
facebook lite
18:34
um majority of the users in that city
18:37
do have bandwidth constraints uh
18:40
how would you think about going about
18:42
expanding into that region or
18:44
you know allowing more user adoption um
18:46
you don't necessarily have to say like
18:47
what specifically you'll do but just
18:48
what questions would you ask and like
18:50
how would you think about that because
18:52
it seems like that's part of the core
18:53
strategy here um but i'd love to hear
18:55
maybe like the concrete steps that you
18:57
might take to
18:58
uh kind of like think about cityville
19:01
and how it plays under the facebook
19:02
ecosystem
19:03
got it got it and i think um like being
19:06
from
19:07
um the middle east i think some cities
19:10
have seen some
19:11
um strategies done by facebook on this
19:14
um on this thing
19:15
and i think that's more or less like a
19:17
universal strategy that can be
19:19
um tailored to two regions so i think
19:22
i've seen two strategies that i think
19:24
they are brilliant and i would
19:26
definitely
19:26
do them as well um one is
19:30
um partnering up with um like
19:33
manufacturers of phones
19:35
um so basically you have facebook lite
19:37
pre-installed
19:39
i think that removes a lot of the
19:40
friction and it makes discoverability a
19:43
lot easier
19:44
so you buy a new phone and then you have
19:46
facebook lite already installed
19:48
so that's a lot easier from going and
19:50
downloading and figuring it out
19:52
the other thing is a partnership with
19:56
local telcos so i've seen this
19:59
in different cities and in different
20:00
areas where basically
20:03
telcos would would tell you that if you
20:05
use facebook lite then it won't
20:07
be um calculated against your overall
20:10
internet code
20:11
so that gives you another motivation and
20:15
that's like advertisement plus
20:17
motivation to actually
20:19
go and explore facebook live and and use
20:21
that and
20:22
engage more with the app the more you
20:24
engage i think
20:26
pretty much you'll have more friends who
20:27
are trying to get on board as well
20:30
and um that's a win-win for telcos and
20:32
that's
20:33
for facebook as well got it um that's
20:35
great yeah
20:36
uh it sounds like the partnerships are
20:38
really key there with the manufacturers
20:39
and the telcos and that might be part of
20:41
your
20:41
your strategy when you actually kind of
20:43
implement this goal
20:45
um okay albert is there anything else
20:47
that you think would be important to
20:48
share about this interview question
20:49
before we move on to feedback and
20:51
talk a little bit about how it went yeah
20:53
i think um
20:54
there is one point that i wanted to also
20:56
mention that i wrote down
20:57
um and that is the overall trade-off and
21:01
um the the basically the example that i
21:04
mentioned where
21:04
someone with a powerful phone might
21:06
install this facebook light
21:08
i think that's that's something that um
21:11
that
21:12
could uh potentially uh pose a threat
21:14
here in terms of like
21:16
cannibalization um so
21:20
we might have people migrating from the
21:23
normal facebook app to facebook light
21:25
and that could signal a problem that we
21:28
we need to
21:28
to measure first and then ideally we
21:31
want to understand
21:32
what's driving that behavior if that
21:34
happens so if we
21:36
over sell facebook light maybe
21:39
more people would actually start using
21:41
it that wouldn't have
21:43
the ultimate facebook experience a
21:46
b it might have less um
21:49
i don't know maybe like um advertising
21:52
potential or
21:53
a monetization potential um so it's it's
21:56
really
21:57
um a a very sensitive thing that
22:00
face that like i as the pm of facebook
22:03
lite need to figure out with the rest of
22:05
the company
22:06
with the rest of the pms on the normal
22:08
facebook app to figure out
22:10
what's what's our strategy in terms of
22:12
like do we
22:13
go full in on facebook like how would we
22:15
um
22:16
handle those situations where you have
22:18
someone who's on facebook light and you
22:20
want to
22:20
push them to normal facebook app so i
22:23
think there is a lot of
22:24
um trade-offs that we need to make here
22:26
and to ensure that
22:28
the overall ltv or the overall
22:30
experience for our customers it's
22:31
at at its best yeah that makes a lot of
22:35
sense and it
22:36
it sounds like you might be watching
22:37
that metric as the expansion
22:39
occurs like as you bring more users on
22:41
you might be watching that ltv metric or
22:42
you might be watching
22:43
to see the experience of the different
22:45
sets of users to make sure that that
22:47
doesn't happen
22:48
um cool well abid uh thanks so much for
22:51
doing this interview we can kind of take
22:52
the interviewer hat off and
22:54
i want to just first off hear from you
22:56
in your own words like how do you think
22:57
that went
22:58
um a little bit of self-reflection on
23:00
the interview and then i can share my
23:02
feedback as well and
23:03
again for those watching do please like
23:05
and subscribe if you thought that this
23:06
video was helpful or valuable to you
23:08
it was an amazing conversation and
23:12
i think it went really smooth however i
23:15
wish as an interviewee i had
23:17
more structure to kind of like
23:20
anticipate the questions that you will
23:22
raise and address them in my answers
23:25
um this way i sound more prepared and
23:28
kind of like thought through
23:30
um one thing that i felt i didn't do a
23:33
lot is that
23:34
i did not pose and and really think
23:36
strategically about the questions
23:39
i i was maybe a little bit
23:42
too excited to hear this problem because
23:45
i i feel it's
23:45
it's a relevant problem for me and then
23:48
i was giving answers very quickly
23:50
i think one advice um is to slow down
23:53
and take notes and
23:55
structure my answers in a proper way
23:59
um god i mean all great points and uh
24:01
yeah i think pausing is one of the
24:03
things that feels
24:04
so unnatural but it's so so important
24:05
for interviews and i tell everyone
24:08
uh that you can totally pause it's okay
24:10
to pause and it's not a problem
24:12
um so i i wanted to run through some of
Interview analysis
24:14
the notes that i wrote down that i
24:15
thought were really effective about what
24:17
you did
24:18
um you started with the mission it was
24:19
really fantastic the way you started you
24:21
were saying like you know
24:22
facebook is about inclusivity and that's
24:24
why this is part of our product
24:25
experience
24:26
and now we're going to bubble down to
24:27
here and i even asked you kind of a
24:28
tough follow-up on bump and newspaper
24:30
stuff and i think you handled that
24:31
really well
24:32
um i will say like at some points in the
24:34
middle i started
24:35
starting to get lost in terms of the
24:37
structure or in terms of like what
24:39
exactly is the goal or what exactly is
24:40
your justification for that goal
24:42
um and are there multiple goals or are
24:44
there not multiple goals and it just
24:45
helps to kind of set up front and say
24:47
like hey this is my goal this is the one
24:49
goal that i think we should focus on
24:50
um or these are the two goals that i
24:52
think we should focus on things like
24:53
that
24:54
um and then i think uh you also did a
24:56
really good job of kind of like
24:57
talking through all the different
24:59
experiences and uh
25:01
experiences that you had so i thought
25:03
there was towards the end we had a
25:04
really great
25:05
example of like hey you know from where
25:07
i'm from like this is some things that
25:08
i've seen that were effective
25:10
um and i thought it was helpful to bring
25:12
in that knowledge and bring that
25:13
expertise and
25:14
show that you are thoughtful about
25:15
products um you know if we had more time
25:17
i would even encourage you to double
25:18
down even more on that and say like
25:20
this is what i thought was effective
25:21
about telcos versus manufacturers you
25:24
know
25:24
telling me something a little more
25:25
interesting or a little more in-depth
25:26
that leverages your
25:28
knowledge could be really really
25:29
effective um and then another tactic
25:31
that i thought you did that was very
25:32
effective is that you
25:33
assumed that much product was mature and
25:36
you used that as kind of like a
25:37
justification for the product decisions
25:39
that you were using
25:40
and i think that makes sense because
25:41
honestly you're going to have to pick
25:42
something and
25:43
kind of like making that assumption seem
25:45
like a reasonable one given that
25:46
facebook light has been around for quite
25:47
a while
25:48
um so i thought that was a pretty
25:49
effective approach as well
25:51
um and i did ask um a lot of follow-up
25:54
questions in this one so i do want to
25:55
acknowledge both for you and for the
25:56
viewers that
25:57
um this is uh more of a conversational
25:59
type of interview and these can
26:01
totally happen in interviews it's a
26:02
little hard to tell sometimes the
26:03
interviewer will give you a lot of space
26:05
to talk
26:05
sometimes the interviewer will keep kind
26:07
of pushing you and pushing around and
26:09
trying to see if you
26:10
uh can handle some of the follow-up
26:12
questions and so i think you did a
26:14
really effective job uh
26:15
keeping your calm and answering those
26:16
follow-up questions and navigating
26:18
through that interview
26:19
um any reactions thoughts or comments to
26:22
what i just shared
26:23
no no 100 i think um you're absolutely
26:26
right
26:27
i think in my experience as you
26:29
mentioned probably
26:30
i'm in my experience i had both types of
26:32
interviews i had the
26:34
conversational interview where it felt
26:36
like i'm just chatting
26:38
with a friend who's like super
26:40
interested in this technology and we're
26:41
just like kind of
26:42
thinking about it like like someone has
26:44
appeared in my company
26:46
and it actually went great and sometimes
26:49
you need the structure
26:50
so it depends um and i think yeah both
26:53
could happen
26:54
well thanks everyone for watching thank
