so in today's scenario i want you to
0:01
imagine that um
0:03
we're working at flipkart and we're
0:05
noticing that there's a decline of about
0:07
15 of cart additions to the additions to
0:11
the shopping cart in the last three days
0:13
um can you help us diagnose the issue
0:16
[Music]
0:19
hey everyone we're here today to do
0:21
another product management
0:22
mock interview we're going to be
0:24
focusing on a root cause analysis type
0:27
question which are similar to execution
0:29
questions where you have to figure out
0:30
what's going wrong with a particular
0:32
issue i'm joined here today by kanjin
0:34
um go ahead and introduce yourself for
0:36
folks watching
0:38
hi everyone i'm khanjan i am currently a
0:41
product manager at razer pay which is a
0:44
fintech company in india and uh prior to
0:47
this i completed my postgraduate program
0:50
for the
0:50
from the indian school of business and
0:52
before that i was working at
0:54
for a couple of months at bain and
0:56
company and idea cellular which is one
0:58
of the leading
0:59
leading telecoms of india so that's
1:02
about me
1:02
and i'm super excited to be here today
1:05
awesome well we're excited to have you
1:07
too
1:08
um and so kanjin as mentioned we're
1:10
going to be going through
1:11
a root cause analysis question and so
Question
1:15
i have a certain scenario that i'll
1:17
propose to you and then we're going to
1:18
talk about how
1:19
to actually go through that issue does
1:21
that make sense
1:22
awesome okay so in today's scenario i
1:25
want you to imagine
1:26
that um we're working at flipkart and
1:29
we're noticing that there's a decline of
1:31
about 15
1:33
of cart additions to the additions to
1:35
the shopping cart in the last three days
1:37
um can you help us diagnose the issue
1:40
uh sure so stephen before i jump into
1:44
uh sort of finding out what the problem
1:46
is uh just want to understand
Clarifying questions
1:48
what do we define as cart additions here
1:51
so that we are on the same page got it
1:53
so cart editions are
1:55
let's imagine a user that's on the flip
1:58
cart experience
1:59
the flipkart app um they add an item to
2:02
their cart so they may click
2:04
and and their an item appears in their
2:06
shopping cart
2:08
sure also uh flipkart has both website
2:12
and mobile app
2:13
so are we looking at a generic 15
2:16
decline or has it been observed only on
2:18
the mobile or
2:18
app or the website we're noticing it
2:21
mostly on the mobile app experience
2:24
okay sure uh
2:27
so i will just take two minutes to sort
2:30
of make my
2:31
framework and think about flipkart in
2:32
general and uh
2:34
will then share the framework same
2:36
framework awesome
2:37
take your time
2:41
okay
2:44
yeah okay i'm ready uh so stephen now
Factors
2:48
our first question is uh the card
2:50
additions that we are measuring
2:52
so it's sort of like a metric uh which
2:54
might be measured
2:55
using some analytics tool uh so have we
2:59
checked whether this analytics tool was
3:01
working well
3:02
over the last three days yeah that's a
3:04
great
3:05
yeah that's a great question so um we
3:09
talked to the analytics team we want to
3:10
make sure that this data is correct or
3:12
right
3:13
um and it does seem like the data coming
3:15
through is
3:16
um good like there's no issues with
3:19
logging or analytics that have happened
3:21
in the last few days
3:23
okay so now that we have all of that
3:25
answered i will just share
3:27
briefly my outline of the framework that
3:29
i'm going to follow to arrive at the
3:31
root cause
3:32
uh so first i will look at the external
3:35
factors
3:35
which will involve uh note which will
3:38
involve uh getting information
3:40
on what competitors uh have done in the
3:43
last three days has there been any
3:45
product launch or
3:46
has there been any new announcement
3:48
which might have taken away
3:49
a certain uh customer base or certain
3:53
uh product uh so which might have taken
3:56
away certain customer base from flipkart
3:59
second we look at the demographic
4:02
feature so has it
4:03
affected any particular customer segment
4:06
or any particular demographic feature of
4:10
that particular
4:11
customer segment third we look at the
4:14
macro economic feature
4:16
macro economic changes so has there been
4:18
any news or any
4:20
seasonality impact or any kind of
4:23
uh pattern in the external factors which
4:28
which might impact the overall
4:30
purchasing behavior
4:33
um fourth would be what are the
4:36
internal changes that we have done so
4:38
have we made any updates in the mobile
4:40
app
4:40
have we made any design changes etc
4:43
um then will be the overall journey of
4:47
the user
4:48
on the mobile app because we are closing
4:51
it down on the mobile app so we will see
4:52
all the steps of the user journey and
4:54
we'll
4:55
see if any particular point before the
4:58
cart auditions has experienced
4:59
any glitch or bugs so we'll basically
5:02
look at any incidents that have come up
5:05
uh and if none of this is the reason
5:08
then we might look at certain uh
5:11
certain factors which are out of control
5:13
but which still might impact
5:16
the overall purchasing behavior uh so
5:19
does that look good to you
5:20
yeah that sounds great thanks for laying
5:22
it all out sure
5:24
so as i mentioned so the first question
5:27
is uh
5:28
uh in india especially flipkart uh has a
5:31
couple of
5:31
e-commerce giants as competition and
5:35
so have has there been any new
5:37
announcement or entry of any competitor
5:40
or any kind of a product launch
5:43
or a big billion sale or uh sorry big
5:46
billion sales for flipkart so any sale
5:48
that has been announced
5:50
yeah that's a great question so we want
5:52
to see if there's a competitor
5:54
um we have limited knowledge here at
5:56
flipkart so we don't fully know
5:58
um what the competitors are doing from a
5:59
cursory perspective or looking at social
6:02
media profiles things like that we're
6:03
not seeing anything in particular
6:05
um but there it's not entirely clear
6:08
there could be some detailed targeting
6:10
or some
6:10
you know customized um campaigns that
6:13
we're not
6:14
visible to or not visible to us
6:17
i see okay uh so uh also
6:20
have we observed if this has impacted
6:23
customers from a certain city or a
6:26
region uh so is there any impact of
6:29
location
6:29
on this particular decline we're not
6:32
seeing an impact of location on the
6:34
decline so when we look at the location
6:35
we're seeing a spread across many
6:37
different places
6:38
okay great uh also has any particular
6:42
segment been impacted so let's say
6:44
females of age 20 to 30 who were earlier
6:47
purchasing a lot of cosmetics have
6:49
suddenly not started so suddenly stop
6:51
purchasing that
6:52
or is it again a uniform distribution
6:55
yeah so um we can look at some basic uh
6:59
factors like gender age location
7:02
and we're not seeing a deviation for any
7:04
of those sort of big demographic
7:06
categories that we typically look at
7:07
okay
7:08
thanks for clarifying that uh so now we
7:11
will look at
7:12
what flipkart has been doing um so has
7:15
a flipkart announced any campaign or any
7:19
uh other let's say prop product or any
7:23
other
7:24
um uh sort of a subsidiary which might
7:28
have taken
7:29
attention away from the mobile app
7:33
um we definitely launch campaigns all
7:35
the time
7:36
um it's not clear that any one of these
7:39
campaigns would be
7:40
taking users away from the mobile app or
7:43
there'd be any detriment to the mobile
7:44
app but we do have campaigns running
7:46
um is there something specific that
7:48
you're hoping to get with
7:50
with that or right so how i would look
7:52
at this
7:53
is uh considering that we don't see any
7:56
pattern in the demographics and the
7:58
geography
7:59
we would first look at the products uh
8:02
if there is any pattern in the kind of
8:04
products which have seen a decline in
8:05
card editions and
8:07
if we can identify that if there is a
8:09
pattern
8:10
or if there is even a pattern among the
8:13
categories then we can look at the
8:14
campaigns which
8:15
were running for those particular
8:17
categories and products
8:19
and then we can sort of attribute the
8:21
decline to that so
8:23
do you have any information on that
8:26
right
8:26
um so we when we look at the campaign
8:29
data and things like that we're not it
8:31
doesn't seem like there's a correlation
8:33
to a decline in the mobile app
8:34
experience
8:35
sure okay uh so then i'll move ahead
8:38
with the
8:38
technical parts of it uh so uh
8:42
as uh so just to summarize for everyone
8:44
who's doing this uh
8:46
when the customer will open flipkart or
8:49
launch the flipkart app on their mobiles
8:52
uh if they have
8:53
already signed in to the app then they
8:55
will directly see their home page
8:57
uh so the first thing that they will see
9:00
is the home page
9:01
versus if they are going to sign in for
9:03
the first time the first
9:04
screen that they will see is the login
9:06
screen versus if they are a new user
9:09
they would see a sign up screen so
9:12
this will be the first touch point for
9:14
the customer so
9:15
the next thing that i would want to know
9:17
is have there been any upgrades to the
9:20
mobile app in the last three days
9:22
on both ios and android yes there
9:25
actually has been we've done a major
9:27
update in the last
9:28
few days um to the mobile apps
9:32
okay and uh are these updates uh
9:36
related to anything uh in the cart
9:39
edition
9:40
uh touch cart audition milestone or
9:44
are they not at all related to that we
9:47
definitely
9:47
we've made some changes that affect the
9:49
whole shopping cart flow
9:51
so there definitely is a relationship
9:52
between the changes that we pushed
9:54
and the experience that we might be
9:57
serving to our users
9:59
okay so uh like can you be a little more
10:02
specific as in
10:03
uh have we made some design changes
10:05
which would maybe
10:06
increase the discovery of our products
10:08
or have we
10:10
offered an easier checkout journey
10:14
or have we enhanced the maybe or have
10:18
you changed the look and feel of the
10:20
add to cart buttons yeah so we have
10:24
improved the checkout flow um to make it
10:26
more seamless
10:27
in an effort to improve the conversion
10:30
rate on the checkout experience
10:33
right uh also uh have we observed if
10:37
this decline is only to ios
10:39
customers or only to android customers
10:42
uh we are seeing that a client only on
10:45
android customers
10:47
oh okay
10:51
right and uh have we received any
10:53
incidents or bugs report
10:55
uh on the uh app changes that have been
10:58
done
10:59
so uh from any kind of customers or uh
11:03
it's i mean we haven't received any uh
11:05
reports but we still think
11:07
that the upgrade might have done
11:08
something yeah we're not seeing
11:11
so many more reports especially since we
11:13
launched the experience maybe a few days
11:14
ago
11:15
but we are seeing an increase in some
11:17
bug reports um
11:19
and it seems like there's some bug
11:21
reports that people are having issues
11:23
paying or checking out their products
11:26
right
11:26
uh so now uh to go a little more deeper
11:29
into the issue
11:30
uh i feel that it is something to do
11:32
with
11:33
uh the process from right from uh seeing
11:36
the product and
11:38
uh finalizing the product to the
11:41
checkout process
11:42
uh but because we are observing a
11:44
decline in the cart
11:46
editions uh the first and the directly
11:48
attributable
11:49
uh feature to that would be the add to
11:52
cart
11:53
uh option so first point where the
11:57
customer would see that button is on the
12:00
product listing page so it does not
12:03
necessarily have to be
12:04
uh specifically the page of that product
12:07
but it will be like a generic listing
12:09
uh so is the button visible there for
12:12
all the products
12:14
um the button so you're asking if the
12:17
button is visible for all the products
12:19
for the set of users
12:20
um we can spin up a dev version and kind
12:22
of take a look at it
12:24
and it does look like the button is
12:26
visible to us
12:27
we're not totally sure if there are
12:29
other versions where the button might
12:30
not be visible but as far as we can tell
12:32
it seems like the button
12:34
is visible on the platforms that we're
12:36
looking at
12:38
okay and uh once the again so
12:41
now it comes to the journey from
12:44
seeing a a list of products to
12:47
selecting the particular product that
12:49
the customer wants to add to cart and
12:52
then clicking on the button
12:53
and then uh that particular action or
12:56
that particular
12:57
click to action translating that
13:00
particular
13:01
product to show in the customers cart so
13:05
what we need to do is we need to observe
13:06
if this particular
13:08
flow is getting completed so uh
13:11
have we logged in the event data or have
13:13
we observed the events data wherein
13:16
the add to cart event is
13:19
uh transitioning into the actual product
13:22
adding being added in the card do we
13:24
have that information
13:25
yeah so when we take a look at the data
13:27
um we actually see that there's been no
13:29
cart additions
13:30
on android um in the past few days so
13:33
we're actually seeing a huge decline in
13:35
card editions on that specific
13:37
version of android that we've launched
13:38
uh version of the app on android
13:41
right so uh then steven i feel uh
13:44
that because we are not
13:47
noticing or we don't have any
13:49
attributable data
13:50
to the uh installs
13:53
of app as such um also the product
13:57
discovery or the product visibility
14:00
doesn't seem to be
14:01
an issue as well uh my bet would be on
14:04
the add to cart button
14:06
so we should probably uh do
14:09
a complete analysis on the
14:13
event flow for every customer on the
14:16
android app
14:17
to check how many customers are actually
14:20
clicking on the
14:21
add to cart button and not seeing or not
14:24
uh
14:25
or their products are not being added to
14:26
the cart
14:28
so that's where the issue seems to be
14:30
lying
14:31
yeah you totally got it um and i mean we
14:34
can go a little bit further into this
14:36
and talk about where exactly the issue
14:37
is or how we debug it
14:39
um but i think you sort of nailed it on
14:41
the head um maybe if you could just
Summary
14:42
summarize one last time
14:44
for the viewers before we go to some
14:46
feedback and things like that
14:47
um of sort of your your journey through
14:49
this flow and
14:51
how you came to the answer that you came
14:52
to uh so
14:54
how one should see any problem
14:58
coming in any metric for a product or a
15:00
particular product feature is
15:02
that first we look at the external
15:04
reasons so
15:06
more often than not especially for
15:08
e-commerce websites
15:10
a lot of external factors such as
15:12
campaigns or competitions announcements
15:14
or the company's own announcements they
15:17
lead to
15:17
a shift in trend for the customers
15:21
and that may lead to a certain segment
15:24
of customers not
15:25
actually adding things to the cart or
15:28
not actually looking at purchasing at
15:31
that particular point in time
15:33
so considering that we were looking at a
15:34
three-day window
15:36
i had to sort of understand if and it's
15:39
a big window so i had to understand if
15:41
in those three days uh any such
15:43
announcement from the competition or any
15:45
such new product launch from the
15:46
competition
15:47
was affecting the card editions on
15:50
flipkart
15:51
once that was out of the way uh we look
15:53
at which particular
15:55
location or segment of customers have
15:58
been impacted if
15:59
at all there is uh there is an
16:01
identifiable pattern in that
16:03
then we can directly attribute that to
16:06
the shift in
16:07
maybe the purchasing power or the
16:10
uh the trends or the various uh factors
16:14
that may be contributing to the way they
16:17
uh come on flipkart and add products to
16:19
the card
16:21
once that is out of the way uh we look
16:23
at the
16:24
residence of that particular problem on
16:26
our ecosystem
16:28
so is it on the website or on the mobile
16:31
app or we
16:31
really don't have any data on that which
16:33
is a very unlikely scenario we usually
16:36
can attribute that very well from the
16:38
data so
16:39
here because we observed that it is
16:41
residing
16:42
in the mobile app and uh after a little
16:45
more probing
16:46
uh we also found out that it is on the
16:48
android
16:49
uh play store itself so the android
16:51
version is facing the problems
16:53
uh we surely know that it is not uh
16:57
attributable to any change in the
16:59
external factors and it is rather
17:01
something that is internal to flipkart
17:03
so once we know that it is an internal
17:05
problem we start looking at the
17:07
funnel and the conversion from each step
17:10
in the funnel so right from the installs
17:13
to the sign
17:14
ups to the product discovery to the
17:17
visibility of the various buttons on the
17:19
product listing page
17:21
to the clickability of the particular
17:24
buttons
17:24
and then we identify how many clicks
17:27
have actually resulted
17:28
in the action to get completed
17:32
so in this case uh that was our best bet
17:35
because
17:35
before that we didn't find any problem
17:38
so
17:38
that's how i arrived at the final uh
17:41
answer that this might be the actual
17:43
root cause of the
17:44
cart edition so declining by 15
17:48
awesome um well kanji that was awesome
17:50
to see you go through that
17:52
i wrote a bunch of notes about what i
17:53
thought you did really well um but
17:55
before we jump into it we'd love to hear
17:56
a self-reflection what do you think went
17:58
well about that interview what do you
18:00
think
18:00
didn't or would you change if you can go
18:02
back and then i can jump into some
18:04
feedback
18:05
and we can talk generally yeah so
18:08
uh first so first i'll talk about the
18:11
areas of improvement that i feel i
18:13
should have done better
18:15
or i could have done better the first
18:17
one being
18:18
when i asked you about the website and
18:20
the mobile app
18:23
issue so where exactly the cart editions
18:26
were observed and you did tell me that
18:28
it was in the mobile app i should have
18:30
asked you a bit more about
18:31
where or which versions of mobile app or
18:35
which play store uh was this particular
18:38
issue happening on or which particular
18:40
device type or this
18:42
issue was happening on uh that answer
18:44
would have given me a much better
18:46
visibility
18:47
into uh the funnel so i could have
18:50
understood that because it's
18:51
on android and not apple i could have
18:54
understood that it is something
18:56
which is a bug issue and not exactly
18:59
a customer side of an issue or a or an
19:02
external issue
19:04
so that's one and second is uh because
19:07
it's a root cause analysis
19:08
uh or it might have been the case that
19:12
uh i should have probably asked for a
19:14
little more data
19:16
so in terms of the numbers so in the
19:18
real world i would have
19:20
probably just gone on my analytics
19:23
board and i would have asked for a lot
19:25
more data uh so that is another thing
19:27
that i could have improved on
19:28
um in terms of what i did good i think
19:31
uh
19:32
the framework uh that i made however it
19:35
might have
19:35
not been it might not have been required
19:40
to look at so many factors but
19:42
if you develop a habit of looking at
19:44
everything
19:45
from a 360 degree view then you don't
19:48
tend to miss out on things and
19:49
it becomes like a general way of solving
19:52
things
19:52
which as a pm i feel helps a lot in the
19:55
longer run
19:56
um so that is what i think i did good
20:01
totally yeah um definitely agree with
20:04
you i mean overall i thought this was a
Interview analysis
20:06
really smooth excellent answer of a root
20:08
cause analysis question
20:10
um they can get very scary and hairy
20:12
because you don't know
20:14
where to go with it and it feels very
20:16
intimidating um
20:17
like oh is this the right direction or
20:19
is that the right direction etc etc and
20:21
i thought you handled that very well
20:22
and what i really loved about your
20:24
answer is in the beginning you sort of
20:25
started off with a full framework of
20:27
okay these are the ways that i'm going
20:29
to go about this problem um
20:30
i'm going to think about it like um
20:33
through this and then this and then this
20:34
and then this
20:35
um and and kind of go through that and i
20:38
definitely did wish we
20:39
came back to that in the in the middle
20:40
or if there was a white board
20:42
or something like that it could be
20:43
really helpful because then um
20:45
i could really see like okay hey like
20:47
this is where
20:48
um this is where that issue
20:51
was or something and like therefore
20:53
we've eliminated this hypothesis or
20:55
something like that
20:56
um i also um i i thought you don't know
21:00
the the going back to the hypothesis was
21:03
really
21:04
you did this a couple times or you
21:05
summarized or you were like okay this is
21:06
now
21:07
where i think i am or this is now what
21:08
we're going to do um i thought that was
21:10
especially great when you did that with
21:12
the
21:12
cart analysis we're like okay now let's
21:14
just really dive into the flow and look
21:16
at the flow
21:16
and see where the issue is in the flow i
21:18
thought that was really effective too
21:20
um i i one thing that um i
21:23
wanted to call out that um you know i
21:26
hope you don't mind sharing but
21:27
or that i share with the audience is um
21:30
there's a thing that a lot of
21:32
interviewees do and it's called
21:34
up speaking um i don't know if you're
21:35
familiar but it's it's sort of when at
21:37
the end of your sentence you go up
21:39
like answering it like a question um
21:42
kind of at the end
21:42
of things and i think um that was one
21:45
piece of feedback i did notice is that
21:46
you did that a couple times throughout
21:48
the interview
21:48
um and it took away from the confidence
21:50
and the gravitas of what you were saying
21:52
um and it's a hard habit sometimes i do
21:55
it too actually when i answer interview
21:56
questions
21:57
but i just thought it'd be helpful to
21:59
share to the audience as well um that
22:01
it's something just to watch for when
22:02
you watch recordings of yourself doing
22:04
interviews or
22:05
um especially at exponent we always
22:07
really recommend people record
22:08
themselves and watch themselves because
22:10
then you see all the flaws the
22:12
sort of tough things but that's just one
22:14
common behavior interviews
22:15
um that always can can make you sound a
22:17
little bit more confident a little bit
22:19
more
22:19
um sort of like uh steady in your answer
22:22
um any reactions thoughts comments to
22:24
any of the feedback i just shared
22:26
uh no i think yeah a very fair point so
22:28
i'd like to add on that
22:30
uh the way uh a lot of uh
22:33
your pm interview also depends on the
22:35
confidence and the
22:36
smoothness with which you approach the
22:38
question because
22:40
it tends to get very intimidating in the
22:42
real world scenario
22:44
for example i remember when i was
22:45
interviewing for the companies last year
22:48
uh in 30 minutes we were expected to
22:51
solve all
22:52
at least two interview at least two
22:53
cases and
22:55
uh if you don't have a control on
22:58
how you are speaking and what you are
22:59
speaking and not writing it
23:01
at the same time and showing it to the
23:03
interviewer the interviewer might just
23:05
lose
23:06
track of what you're doing and that can
23:08
cost you a lot so
23:09
a very fair point totally
23:12
um yeah and actually i mean to sort of
23:15
close or wrap toward the end of this
23:17
conversation
23:18
um if folks want to learn more you can
23:21
always check out exponent
23:22
at tryexponent.com we help people land
23:25
their dream tech
23:26
job with our courses our coaching and
23:28
our vibrant community
23:29
we believe that people shouldn't
23:31
interview alone the reason i bring this
23:33
up now is that
23:34
part of exponent's mission is to help
23:35
people practice better and there have
23:37
been studies to show that
23:38
practicing for interviews just getting
23:40
those reps in can go a long way towards
23:42
building that confidence
23:43
and getting that um type of interview
23:46
that you want to see
23:47
in the interview to succeed um and so um
23:50
i did want to just
23:51
mention that about exponent but before
23:54
we close conjunct do you have any ask
23:55
last thoughts tips um anything else you
Tips
23:58
wanted to share with folks watching
24:00
yeah so firstly i would like to top your
24:03
closing comment that i have
24:05
in fact prepared a lot of my product
24:08
cases
24:09
watching exponent mock interviews uh so
24:12
definitely
24:13
that's one tip that i can give that any
24:16
any mock interviews
24:17
will help you get a sense of what kind
24:20
of questions can come up and
24:22
how should you hold the conversation
24:24
during a product management interview
24:27
uh again continuing on that point uh
24:29
what happens is
24:31
that a lot of people feel that because
24:33
it's a product case
24:34
you in order to show that you know
24:37
everything and that you're an expert
24:39
people don't make conversation and they
24:41
forget to ask questions or they forget
24:43
to course correct themselves
24:45
during the process and hence they get so
24:47
lost in their own
24:49
uh points that it just leads to a very
24:52
jumbled up
24:53
solution so yeah that would be my final
24:56
uh comment and lastly for any
24:59
help on product cases uh one should
25:03
always refer to
25:04
uh or one should always fall back on
25:06
actual practice
25:07
so you will have your peers or your
25:10
family members or your cousins friends
25:12
whoever you can find
25:14
just speaking to them and just telling
25:17
them to be
25:18
your interviewer will give you a lot of
25:20
confidence which
25:21
will help you in the actual scenario
25:25
awesome um and if you're looking to
